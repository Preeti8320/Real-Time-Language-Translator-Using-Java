Project Overview
The project is a simple user registration and profile management system built using Java Servlets, JSP, and JDBC for database interaction. It includes features for user registration, login, profile viewing, and updating user information.

            Key Components
Model Class:

User .java: Represents the user entity with properties like id, username, password, email, and fullName.
Data Access Object (DAO):

User DAO.java: Handles database operations related to users, including saving a user and retrieving a user by username.
Service Layer:

User Service.java: Contains business logic for user operations, such as registering a user and retrieving user details.
Servlets:

RegistrationServlet.java: Handles user registration requests and saves user data to the database.
LoginServlet.java: Validates user credentials and redirects to the profile page upon successful login.
ProfileServlet.java: Fetches user details from the database and forwards them to the profile JSP.
UpdateProfileServlet.java: Updates user details in the database based on form submissions from the profile JSP.
JSP Pages:

register.jsp: A form for user registration.
login.jsp: A form for user login.
profile.jsp: Displays user profile information and allows updates.
userList.jsp: Displays a list of all registered users (if applicable).
registrationSuccess.jsp: Confirms successful registration.
Testing:

User DAOTest.java: Unit tests for the User DAO class, verifying database operations.
User ServiceTest.java: Unit tests for the User Service class, verifying business logic and interactions with the DAO.
Functionality
User Registration: Users can register by providing a username, password, email, and full name. Upon successful registration, they are redirected to a success page.
User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials. Successful login redirects them to their profile page.
Profile Management: Users can view their profile information and update their email and full name.
Data Persistence: User data is stored in a MySQL database, with the option to use an in-memory database for testing.
Security Considerations
Password Handling: In a production application, passwords should be hashed (e.g., using BCrypt) before storing them in the database.
Input Validation: Ensure that user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, especially sensitive information like passwords.
Final Checks
Code Quality: Ensure that the code follows Java naming conventions and best practices.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in servlets to provide user-friendly error messages.
Testing: Run all unit tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected.
Documentation: Consider adding comments and documentation to explain the purpose of classes and methods.
Conclusion
The project is well-structured and functional, providing a solid foundation for a user registration and profile management system. With the addition of unit tests, the application is more robust and maintainable.
