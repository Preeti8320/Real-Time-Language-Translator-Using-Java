Project Overview
The User Registration and Profile Management System is a web application that allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile information. Built using Java Servlets, JSP, and JDBC, this application provides a simple interface for user management.

Technologies Used
Java: Programming language used for the application.
Servlets: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): For rendering dynamic web content.
JDBC: For database connectivity.
MySQL: Database for storing user information.
JUnit: For unit testing.
Mockito: For mocking dependencies in tests.
H2: In-memory database for testing purposes.

            Key Components
Model Class:

User .java: Represents the user entity with properties like id, username, password, email, and fullName.
Data Access Object (DAO):

User DAO.java: Handles database operations related to users, including saving a user and retrieving a user by username.
Service Layer:

User Service.java: Contains business logic for user operations, such as registering a user and retrieving user details.
Servlets:

RegistrationServlet.java: Handles user registration requests and saves user data to the database.
LoginServlet.java: Validates user credentials and redirects to the profile page upon successful login.
ProfileServlet.java: Fetches user details from the database and forwards them to the profile JSP.
UpdateProfileServlet.java: Updates user details in the database based on form submissions from the profile JSP.
JSP Pages:

register.jsp: A form for user registration.
login.jsp: A form for user login.
profile.jsp: Displays user profile information and allows updates.
userList.jsp: Displays a list of all registered users (if applicable).
registrationSuccess.jsp: Confirms successful registration.
Functionality
User Registration: Users can register by providing a username, password, email, and full name. Upon successful registration, they are redirected to a success page.
User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials. Successful login redirects them to their profile page.
Profile Management: Users can view their profile information and update their email and full name.
Data Persistence: User data is stored in a MySQL database, with the option to use an in-memory database for testing.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
git clone <repository-url>
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database named user_db.
Run the following SQL script to create the users table:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIM
   CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      full_name VARCHAR(100),
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
- Update the database connection details in the `User DAO.java` class to match your MySQL configuration (username, password, and database URL).

4. **Build the Project**:
- If you are using Maven, navigate to the project directory and run:
  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```

5. **Deploy the Application**:
- Deploy the application to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat. Place the WAR file in the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation.

6. **Start the Tomcat Server**:
- Start your Tomcat server and access the application in your web browser:
http://localhost:8080/UserRegistrationApp/register.jsp

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
- The project includes unit tests for the `User DAO` and `User Service` classes.
- To run the tests, use the following Maven command:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

2. **Manual Testing**:
- After deploying the application, manually test the following functionalities:
  - User registration
  - User login
  - Profile viewing and updating
  - Ensure that all features work as expected.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Handling**: In a production application, always hash passwords before storing them in the database. Use libraries like BCrypt for secure password hashing.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, especially sensitive information like passwords.
- **Session Management**: Implement proper session management to prevent session hijacking.

## Future Enhancements

- **Password Recovery**: Implement a password recovery feature to allow users to reset their passwords.
- **Email Verification**: Add email verification during registration to ensure valid email addresses.
- **User  Roles**: Implement user roles (e.g., admin, user) to manage access to different parts of the application.
- **Improved UI**: Enhance the user interface using modern front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or React.
- **API Development**: Consider developing a RESTful API for mobile or other client applications.

## Conclusion

The User Registration and Profile Management System is a functional web application that provides essential features for user management. With a solid architecture, unit tests, and security considerations, this project serves as a good foundation for further enhancements and real-world applications.
